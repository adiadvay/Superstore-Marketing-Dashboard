# Superstore Marketing Insights Dashboard

## Overview
This project automates the creation of a marketing insights dashboard in Excel using Python, analyzing sales data from the Superstore dataset (2014–2017). It provides actionable insights for marketing teams through data summaries and visualizations, showcasing my skills in data analysis, automation, and visualization.

## Features

- **Monthly Sales Trend**: Line chart tracking sales from 2014 to 2017.
- **Regional Performance**: Bar chart comparing sales across South, West, Central, and East regions.
- **Profit vs. Discount Analysis**: Scatter plot exploring how discounts impact profitability.
- **Top 5 Products**: Table highlighting the highest-selling products.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: `pandas` for data manipulation, `openpyxl` for Excel automation and chart creation.
- **Excel**: Output file (`superstore_dashboard_portfolio.xlsx`) with dynamic tables and charts.
